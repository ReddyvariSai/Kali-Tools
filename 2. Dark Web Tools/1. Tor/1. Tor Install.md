#  Tor


To install Tor on Kali Linux, open a terminal and run the following commands to update the package list and install the Tor service and Tor Browser Launcher:
```

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y tor torbrowser-launcher
```

After installation, launch Tor Browser by running the command:
```

torbrowser-launcher
```

This will download and install the latest version of Tor Browser, including signature verification. On subsequent launches, it will update and launch the browser automatically.

Alternatively, if you prefer to install Tor manually, you can download the Tor Browser bundle directly from the official Tor Project website.

 However, using the torbrowser-launcher tool is the recommended method as it simplifies the process and ensures automatic updates.
