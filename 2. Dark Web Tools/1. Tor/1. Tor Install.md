To install Tor on Kali Linux, open a terminal and run the following commands to update the package list and install the Tor service and Tor Browser Launcher:

#### Step 1: Update and Upgrade Your System

1. Open a terminal on your Kali Linux system.
2. Run the following commands to update and upgrade your system packages:

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
3. Wait for the update process to complete before proceeding.

#### Step 2: Download Tor Browser

To get Tor Browser on your Kali Linux system, you have two options:

1. Download from the Official Website:

Open any web browser you are using on Kali Linux.

Go to the official Tor Project website by searching for “Tor Browser” or directly visiting this link: https://www.torproject.org.

Once you’re on the site, look for the “Download for Linux” button, which will download the correct version of Tor Browser for your system.

2. Additional Option (torbrowser-launcher):

If you prefer an automatic installation process, you can use torbrowser-launcher, which will handle the download and installation for you. If you’d like to manually download and install, follow the steps below:

In Terminal window type the following command to install the torbrowser-launcher tool:


```
sudo apt install -y tor torbrowser-launcher
```

#### Step 3: Choose the Installation Version

On the download page, select Download for Linux to get the appropriate package for your system.

#### Step 4: Download the GPG Signature and Public Key

Verifying the downloaded file using the GPG signature is essential for security and integrity. This step ensures:

* Authenticity: Confirms that the file originates from the Tor Project and hasn’t been altered by a third party.

* Integrity: Verifies that the download hasn’t been corrupted during transfer.

* Protection Against Malware: Prevents the installation of malicious software masquerading as Tor Browser.

Skipping this step leaves you vulnerable to potential threats, such as compromised software versions that could expose your privacy. Always verify signatures when downloading software from the internet, especially tools like Tor Browser that handle sensitive operations.

To download the GPG signature and public key required for verifying Under the “Download for Linux” option, click the Signature link to download the GPG signature file (.asc) associated with your Tor Browser package.

#### Step 5: Verify the Signature

In the terminal window navigate to your Downloads directory:

```
cd Downloads
```
After extracting the package, check to confirm that the files were extracted correctly by listing the directory contents:

```
ls
```

Crate a new Tor folder and navigate to the new crated folder :

```
mkdir Tor
ls
cd Tor
```

```
mv ~/Downloads/tor-browser-linux-x86_64-14.0.3.tar.xz ~/Downloads/tor-browser-linux-x86_64-14.0.3.tar.xz.asc ~/Downloads/Tor/
```

Check to confirm that the files were moved:

```
ls
```

2. Fetch the Tor Developers’ key from the key server: When successful, you should see output confirming the key import:

```
gpg --auto-key-locate nodefault,wkd --locate-keys torbrowser@torproject.org
```
3. Export the key to a local keyring file:

By creating this keyring file, the verification process becomes isolated and focused solely on the specific key needed for the signature.

It avoids using keys from the system-wide keyring, which ensures a more secure and controlled verification process.

<img width="1100" height="73" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3537daa8-eaf2-427f-be31-1493c58d8647" />
```
gpg  --output ./tor.keyring  --export 0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290
```

This command exports the Tor Project’s GPG public key `(identified by its fingerprint: 0xEF6E286DDA85EA2A4BA7DE684E2C6E8793298290)`into a local file called tor.keyring.

This keyring file will be used as a reference to verify the signature of the downloaded Tor Browser package.

Key Components: — output ./tor.keyring: Specifies that the exported key will be saved to a file named tor.keyring in the current directory.

— export <key>: Exports the public key corresponding to the specified key ID (or fingerprint).

4. You should see the downloaded file by listing the directory contents:

```
ls
```
5. Verify the signature of the downloaded package:

```
gpgv --keyring ./tor.keyring ./tor-browser-linux-x86_64-<version>.tar.xz.asc ./tor-browser-linux-x86_64-<version>.tar.xz
```
Replace <version> with the version number of the downloaded file.
```

gpgv --keyring ./tor.keyring ./tor-browser-linux-x86_64-14.0.3.tar.xz.asc ./tor-browser-linux-x86_64-14.0.3.tar.xz
```

#### Step 6: Extract the Downloaded File

Extract the Tor Browser package:

```
tar -xf tor-browser-linux-x86_64-<version>.tar.xz
```

Replace <version> with the version number of the downloaded file.
```
tar -xf tor-browser-linux-x86_64-14.0.3.tar.xz
```

```
ls
```
#### Step 7: Change Ownership and Permissions

```
sudo chown -R kali:kali ~/Downloads/Tor/tor-browser
ls -ld ~/Downloads/Tor/tor-browser
```
2. Make the folder and its contents executable and Verify Permissions:

```
chmod -R +x ~/Downloads/Tor/tor-browser
ls -l ~/Downloads/Tor/tor-browser
```
#### Step 8: Launch Tor Browser
1. Navigate to the extracted tor-browser directory and List the content:
